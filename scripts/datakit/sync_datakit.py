"""Sync every Datakit source's raw downloads + normalized output between two MARIN-shaped prefixes.

Direction-agnostic: for each :class:`marin.datakit.sources.DatakitSource`,
copies the leaf download directories (the DAG leaves of ``source.normalized``)
AND the source's normalized output directory (``source.normalized.output_path``)
from ``--src-prefix`` to ``--dest-prefix`` while preserving the relative path
layout below the prefix. Intermediate preprocessing steps between download and
normalize are NOT synced — downstream consumers only need the raw inputs and
the canonical normalized artifact.

Use ``--scope`` to widen or narrow the copy: ``normalized`` (default) syncs
only the normalize output, ``raw`` syncs only the download leaves, ``all``
syncs both. Per-scope shard markers and step-status are namespaced so
different scopes never collide on cache state.

Typical use is GCS -> R2 (e.g. ``gs://marin-us-central1`` to
``s3://marin-na/marin``); the reverse works too.

For each source, this script builds a single :class:`StepSpec`. The step's
``fn`` runs a Zephyr pipeline that:

* Lists every object under each source path — both the leaf download
  directories and the normalized output directory — on the source side
  (including files whose names start with ``.`` or ``_`` — S3/GCS treat
  these like any other key).
* Sorts the file list and groups it into deterministic shards of
  ``files_per_shard`` files (default 64). Same input set => same shards.
* For each shard, hashes the sorted ``(rel_path, fingerprint)`` pairs —
  where ``fingerprint`` is the source object's ETag/size/mtime — and uses
  that hash as the filename of the shard's JSONL output under
  ``status_prefix``. Zephyr's ``skip_existing=True`` short-circuits any
  shard whose output already exists. If a source object is rewritten, its
  fingerprint flips, the shard hash changes, the JSONL key doesn't match,
  and the shard is re-copied.
* Otherwise, streams every file in the shard from source to a sibling
  ``.tmp.<uuid>`` key at the destination and publishes it via
  :func:`rigging.filesystem.atomic_rename` (the per-file copies fan out across
  ``copy_threads`` threads), then Zephyr writes the per-shard JSONL — that
  output IS the resume marker. When the destination is ``s3://``, the dst
  ``S3FileSystem`` is constructed with ``fixed_upload_size=True`` so R2
  accepts the multipart upload (AWS S3 accepts uniform-size parts too, so
  the flag is harmless there).
* After all shards complete, copies the leaf's root ``.executor_status``
  marker as a single follow-up op. Its presence on dst is what whole-source
  skip keys off — re-runs of an already-synced source short-circuit before
  any StepSpec is even built.
* Finally, sweeps any ``.tmp.<uuid.hex>`` orphans under the dst leaf —
  leftovers from prior interrupted ``atomic_rename`` runs (ours or
  upstream). They're never legitimate content; deleting them after the
  marker lands keeps the dst byte-identical to src.

Per-shard JSONL and per-source executor status all live under
``status_prefix`` (default ``gs://marin-us-central1/data/datakit/sync``)
namespaced by a hash of ``(src_prefix, dest_prefix)`` so to-R2 and from-R2
runs of the same source don't share markers (their fingerprints aren't
comparable anyway — GCS ETag vs R2 ETag are different schemes for the same
bytes). The status prefix is the permanent record of what has been copied;
there's no TTL to worry about.
