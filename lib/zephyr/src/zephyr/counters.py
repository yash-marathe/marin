"""User-defined counters for Zephyr tasks.

Task code can increment named counters during execution; counters are
aggregated across all tasks and exposed via the coordinator's ``get_counters()``
actor method.

Usage::

    from zephyr import counters

    counters.increment("documents_processed", 100)
    counters.increment("validation_errors")

Counter values are accumulated in-memory on each worker and sent to the
coordinator periodically via heartbeats and as a final snapshot on task
completion.

Outside of a Zephyr worker context, all calls are silent no-ops.
